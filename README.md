# MSTS-RS
Rust based port of Microsoft Train Simulator 2001 (MSTS)

This repository contains all the code for the custom port of MSTS, however you WILL need all the assets from the original game. I will NOT distribute them.

## Instructions
You will need to place the following folders from your original MSTS installation here:

1. ROUTES
2. TRAINS
3. SOUND

Thats it! Just compile and run the application
