# MSTS-RS
Rust based port of Microsoft Train Simulator 2001 (MSTS)

--This repository contains all the code for the custom port of MSTS, however you WILL need all the assets from the original game. I will NOT distribute them.--

MSTS is now abandonware. You can download the ISOs for the game [here](https://www.jumpjet.info/Classic-Games/Windows/MSTS/msts.htm). Once you install the game, copy the folders listed below


## Instructions
You will need to place the following folders from your original MSTS installation here:

1. ROUTES
2. TRAINS
3. SOUND
4. GLOBAL
5. GUI

Thats it! Just compile and run the application
